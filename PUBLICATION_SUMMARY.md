## Recommendations for Publication

### Before Publishing to crates.io
1. Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to validate metadata
2. Verify no sensitive data in Cargo.toml (git revision is internal, OK)
3. Check that repository field correctly points to GitHub
4. Test crate can be installed from GitHub with: `cargo add --git https://github.com/tessera-embeddings/tessera`

### Before Publishing to PyPI
1. Set up maturin or PyO3 build configuration
2. Generate Python binary wheels for:
   - manylinux2014_x86_64 (Linux)
   - macosx_13_0_arm64 (macOS Apple Silicon)
   - macosx_12_0_x86_64 (macOS Intel)
   - win_amd64 (Windows)
3. Configure CI/CD to automatically build and publish wheels
4. Update python/__init__.py with package metadata

### Documentation Maintenance
1. Keep README.md and lib.rs synchronized
2. Update model counts in documentation when new models added
3. Run `cargo doc` as part of CI to catch broken links
4. Consider generating CHANGELOG.md for version 0.1.0 release notes

### Post-Publication
1. Update docs.rs configuration if needed (typically automatic)
2. Add badge to README: `[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tessera.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tessera)`
3. Consider creating dedicated documentation site
4. Monitor user feedback on documentation clarity

## Conclusion

The Tessera library is now documentation-complete for publication. The crate-level documentation in lib.rs provides comprehensive guidance for all users, from beginners trying simple dense embeddings to advanced users implementing multi-vector search with binary quantization and GPU acceleration. The README serves as an accessible entry point, while maintaining consistency with the technical documentation. All five embedding paradigms are thoroughly explained with clear use cases and model availability.

The library is ready for publication to both crates.io and PyPI with full Python support via PyO3.
