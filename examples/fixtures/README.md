# Test Fixtures for Examples

This directory contains test data files used by the example programs.

## Files

### attention_is_all_you_need.pdf
- **Source:** [arXiv:1706.03762](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- **Title:** "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017)
- **Size:** ~2.2 MB, 15 pages
- **Usage:** ColPali document embedding examples
- **Content:** Seminal paper introducing the Transformer architecture
- **License:** arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license

This paper is one of the most influential in modern NLP/AI and makes an excellent test document for vision-language models like ColPali because it contains:
- Dense technical text
- Mathematical equations and formulas
- Diagrams and architecture figures
- Tables with experimental results
- Multi-column layout

## Adding More Fixtures

When adding test files:
1. Keep files reasonably sized (< 5 MB preferred)
2. Use publicly available, properly licensed content
3. Document the source and usage in this README
4. Name files descriptively
