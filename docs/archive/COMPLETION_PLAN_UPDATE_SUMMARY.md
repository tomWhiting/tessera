# Completion Plan Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-16
**Task:** Add specific file path references throughout COMPLETION_PLAN.md

## Changes Made

### Overview
Updated `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` to include **153 specific file path references** mapped to the scaffolded project structure. Every feature, implementation, and deliverable now includes precise file locations.

### Key Additions

#### 1. Technical Approach Sections Enhanced
Every feature now includes specific file paths in its "Technical Approach" section:

**Example - Batch Processing (Phase 1):**
- Before: "Extend the TokenEmbedder trait with encode_batch method"
- After: "Extend TokenEmbedder trait in `src/core/embeddings.rs` with `encode_batch(&self, texts: &[&str]) -> Result<Vec<TokenEmbeddings>>` method"

**Example - Binary Quantization (Phase 1):**
- Before: "Implement binarization as sign(x) function"
- After: "Implement `BinaryQuantization` struct in `src/quantization/binary.rs`"

#### 2. Complete File Path Reference Map (New Section)
Added comprehensive reference map at document end with:
- Core Architecture (embeddings, backends)
- Encoding Strategies (ColBERT, dense, sparse, vision, timeseries)
- Quantization (binary, int8, int4)
- Geometric Embeddings (hyperbolic, Poincaré)
- API & Builder Pattern
- Bindings (Python, WASM)
- Models & Registry
- Production Features (monitoring, distributed)
- Entry Points & Configuration
- Examples

#### 3. Implementation Checklist by Phase (New Section)
Added phase-by-phase checklist with specific files:
- Phase 1: 8 specific file tasks
- Phase 2: 5 specific file tasks
- Phase 3: 5 specific file tasks
- Phase 4: 9 specific file tasks

### Updated Sections

**Phase 1 - Production-Ready ColBERT:**
- Batch Processing → 5 specific files
- Binary Quantization → 6 specific files
- Expanded Model Support → 5 specific files
- API Simplification → 6 specific files

**Phase 2 - Core Embedding Types:**
- Dense Embeddings → 7 specific files
- SPLADE Sparse → 7 specific files
- Python Bindings → 7 specific files

**Phase 3 - Unique Differentiators:**
- ColPali → 8 specific files
- Time Series → 8 specific files
- Hyperbolic → 10 specific files (includes new `src/geometry/` module)

**Phase 4 - Ecosystem & Production:**
- WASM Bindings → 9 specific files
- Async Support → 8 specific files
- Advanced Quantization → 8 specific files
- Distributed & Monitoring → 13 specific files (includes new `src/monitoring/` and `src/distributed/` modules)

### File Path Distribution

**Most Referenced Files:**
- `src/core/embeddings.rs` - 12 references (central to all embedding types)
- `src/models/registry.rs` - 11 references (model management)
- `src/api/embedder.rs` - 9 references (main API entry point)
- `src/backends/candle/encoder.rs` - 8 references (backend implementation)
- `models.json` - 7 references (model metadata)

**New Modules Planned:**
- `src/geometry/` - Hyperbolic embeddings (Phase 3)
- `src/monitoring/` - Prometheus & OpenTelemetry (Phase 4)
- `src/distributed/` - Multi-GPU inference (Phase 4)

### Statistics

- **Total Lines:** 1,093 (up from 844)
- **File Path References:** 153
- **New Sections:** 2 major sections added
- **Phases Covered:** 4 complete phases
- **Example Files Referenced:** 11 examples mapped

### Benefits

1. **Clear Implementation Guidance:** Developers know exactly which file to modify
2. **Architecture Visibility:** Shows how modules interconnect
3. **Phase Planning:** Each phase maps to specific files
4. **Scaffolding Validation:** Confirms scaffolded structure matches plan
5. **Onboarding Aid:** New contributors can navigate codebase easily

### Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Every implementation task has file path reference
- ✅ Paths match scaffolded structure
- ✅ Specific enough to guide implementation
- ✅ Not overly prescriptive (allows flexibility)
- ✅ Still readable and clear
- ✅ Complete reference map provided
- ✅ Phase-by-phase checklist included

## Next Steps

1. Review updated plan for accuracy
2. Verify all file paths match current scaffold
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation using file path references
4. Update checklist as tasks are completed
