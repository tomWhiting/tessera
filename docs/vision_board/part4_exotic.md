# Part 4: Exotic and Geometric Embeddings

## Overview

Exotic embeddings move beyond standard Euclidean vector spaces, leveraging non-Euclidean geometries, hypercomplex algebras, topological methods, and novel mathematical structures. These approaches offer **massive capacity improvements** for specific data types (hierarchies, rotations, uncertainty) while providing theoretical guarantees and interpretability.

### Why Non-Euclidean?

**The Problem with Euclidean Space:**
- Uniform geometry (flat, constant curvature = 0)
- Exponential growth requires exponential dimensions
- Cannot naturally model hierarchies, rotations, or uncertainty

**Non-Euclidean Solutions:**
- **Hyperbolic:** Negative curvature, exponential capacity (hierarchies, trees)
- **Spherical:** Positive curvature, bounded space (directional data, normalization)
- **Product Spaces:** Mix geometries (heterogeneous data)
- **Hypercomplex:** Richer algebraic structure (rotations, physics)

## 1. Hyperbolic Embeddings

### Why Hyperbolic Geometry?

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Hyperbolic space has **constant negative curvature**. The volume grows **exponentially** with distance from any point:
```
Volume(r) ~ e^(r)
```

Compare to Euclidean (polynomial growth):
```
Volume(r) ~ r^n
```

**Key Insight:** Trees and hierarchies have exponentially branching structure → hyperbolic geometry is the natural space for embeddings.

**Embedding Capacity:**
- **Euclidean:** O(r^2) points at distance r
- **Hyperbolic:** O(e^r) points at distance r
- **Gain:** Exponential capacity with same distortion

### 1.1 Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Networks (HyperbolicCV)

**Release Date:** ICLR 2024

**Implementation:** GitHub: kschwethelm/HyperbolicCV (Official PyTorch)

**Geometric Space:** **Lorentz model** of hyperbolic geometry

**Architecture Type:** Fully hyperbolic CNN

**Embedding Dimensions:** Configurable (typically 50-200)

**Mathematical Foundation:**

The Lorentz model represents hyperbolic space as a hyperboloid in Minkowski space:
```
ℍⁿ = {x ∈ ℝⁿ⁺¹ | ⟨x, x⟩_L = -1, x₀ > 0}
```

where the **Lorentzian inner product** is:
```
⟨x, y⟩_L = -x₀y₀ + x₁y₁ + ... + xₙyₙ
```

**Lorentzian distance:**
```
d_L(x, y) = arccosh(-⟨x, y⟩_L)
```

**Why Lorentz Model?**
- Numerically stable (no division by (1-||x||²))
- Natural for relativity (Minkowski spacetime)
- Clean exponential/logarithmic maps

**HyperbolicCV Components:**
- **Hyperbolic Convolution:** Uses Lorentzian distances, exponential/logarithmic maps
- **Hyperbolic Batch Normalization:** Normalize in tangent space, project back
- **Hyperbolic MLR:** Multinomial logistic regression in Lorentz model

**Advantages:**
- Superior on hierarchical data (taxonomies, trees, DAGs)
- **Often 10-100x fewer dimensions** needed vs Euclidean
- Native support for asymmetric relationships
- Principled mathematical framework

**Use Cases:**
- Hierarchical image classification
- Graph neural networks (tree-like structure)
- NLP (syntax trees, semantic hierarchies)
- Knowledge graph embeddings

**Limitations:**
- Computationally more expensive than Euclidean
- Numerical instability requires careful implementation
- Steeper learning curve

**Availability:** Full PyTorch library, ICLR 2024

**Performance:** State-of-the-art on hierarchical computer vision tasks

### 1.2 Hypformer (Hyperbolic Transformer)

**Release Date:** KDD 2024

**Implementation:** GitHub: marlin-codes/hyperbolicTransformer (PyTorch)

**Geometric Space:** Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry

**Architecture Type:** **First hyperbolic transformer with linear attention**

**Mathematical Innovations:**

**1. HTC (Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvature):**
Maps between hyperbolic spaces of different curvatures:
```
HTC_κ₁→κ₂(x) = exp_o^κ₂(√(κ₂/κ₁) log_o^κ₁(x))
```
where exp/log are exponential/logarithmic maps in hyperbolic space, and κ is curvature.

**2. HRC (Hyperbolic Representation Construction):**
Defines LayerNorm, activation functions, dropout, concatenation within hyperbolic geometry

**3. Hyperbolic Linear Attention:**
**First-ever O(n) attention in hyperbolic space** (vs O(n²) for standard)

**Key Insight:** Standard hyperbolic attention is O(n²) which doesn't scale. Hypformer achieves **linear complexity** while maintaining geometric properties.

**Advantages:**
- Scalable to **billion-scale graphs** and long sequences
- O(n) complexity vs O(n²)

### 1.3 Hyperbolic Entailment Cones

**Release Date:** ICML 2018 (foundational, still used in 2024)

**Implementation:** GitHub: dalab/hyperbolic_cones

**Geometric Space:** Poincaré ball or hyperboloid

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Poincaré Ball Model:**
```
𝔹ⁿ = {x ∈ ℝⁿ | ||x|| < 1}
```

with metric:
```
ds² = 4(dx₁² + ... + dxₙ²) / (1 - ||x||²)²
```

**Entailment Cones:** Model partial orders as geodesically convex cones
```
C(x, K, θ) = {y ∈ ℍⁿ | angle_x(y, K) ≤ θ}
```

where:
- x = apex (concept)
- K = cone axis direction
- θ = cone angle

**Key Insight:** In hyperbolic space, cones have exponentially growing volume → general concepts (apex) naturally have many specific instances (toward boundary).

**Advantages:**
- Theoretically optimal for hierarchical embeddings
- Closed-form solution for cone shapes
- Natural asymmetry (A entails B ≠ B entails A)
- Handles transitive and non-transitive relations

**Use Cases:**
- Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Taxonomies and ontologies (WordNet, etc.)
- Hierarchical image classification
- Semantic hierarchies

**Performance:** Orders of magnitude better than Euclidean for tree-like structures

**Why This Matters:** Theoretical foundation for hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings.

## 2. Spherical Embeddings

### 2.1 Von Mises-Fisher (vMF) Embeddings

**Release Date:** Ongoing development through 2024-2025

**Implementation:** Multiple (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

**Geometric Space:** **Hypersphere** (unit sphere in ℝⁿ)

**Architecture:** Probabilistic embeddings on sphere

**Embedding Dimensions:** Typically 128-768

**Mathematical Foundation:**

The **von Mises-Fisher distribution** is the spherical analogue of the Gaussian:
```
f(x; μ, κ) = C_n(κ) exp(κ μᵀx)
```

where:
- μ = mean direction (unit vector on sphere)
- κ ≥ 0 = concentration parameter (inverse variance)
- x = data point on unit sphere
- C_n(κ) = normalization constant

**Why vMF?**
It's the **maximum entropy distribution** on the sphere given a fixed mean direction. This makes it the "natural" probabilistic choice for spherical manifolds.

**Why Spherical Geometry?**
1. **Automatic normalization:** ||x|| = 1 always
2. **Cosine similarity:** Distance naturally measured by angles
3. **Compact:** All points equidistant from origin (no boundary issues)
4. **Directional statistics:** Natural for data with angular structure
5. **Prevents magnitude collapse:** All vectors normalized

**Advantages:**
- Well-calibrated probabilistic predictions
- Natural for cosine similarity tasks (text embeddings)
- Compact boundary (sphere vs unbounded Euclidean)
- Better clustering properties for high-dimensional data
- Uncertainty quantification via concentration parameter κ

**Use Cases:**
- Text embeddings (semantic similarity = angle)
- Face recognition (angular margins)
- Document clustering
- Word embeddings (word2vec implicitly spherical)
- Reinforcement learning (large action spaces)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot model hierarchies (unlike hyperbolic)
- All points equidistant from origin (no depth)
- Less expressive than Euclidean for some non-directional tasks

**Recent Work (2024-2025):**
- **vMF-exp (ICML 2025):** Exploration in RL using vMF sampling
- **Spherical Cauchy VAE:** Alternative to vMF with computational advantages
- **Wasserstein-like geometry:** Novel distance metrics for vMF distributions

**Availability:** Integrated into many embedding frameworks

**Performance:** Competitive with Euclidean while providing better calibration

## 3. Topological Embeddings

### 3.1 TopER (Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation)

**Release Date:** October 2024

**Architecture:** Graph neural network + topological features

**Geometric Space:** Persistence diagram space

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Persistent Homology (PH):** Studies evolution of topological features across scales

Given filtration X₀ ⊆ X₁ ⊆ ... ⊆ Xₙ, PH tracks:
- **Birth:** When feature appears (connected component, loop, void)
- **Death:** When feature disappears
- **Persistence:** death - birth (significance measure)

**Persistence Diagram:** Multiset of (birth, death) points in ℝ²

Features with long lifetimes are topologically significant.

**TopER Simplification:**
Instead of full PH, compute **evolution rate** of substructures:
```
ER(G) = Δ(topological features) / Δ(scale parameter)
```

Gives low-dimensional topological embeddings efficiently.

**Advantages:**
- Captures **global structural properties** (cycles, connected components)
- Complements local GNN features
- Lower computational cost than full persistent homology
- **Provably more expressive** than standard GNNs

**Use Cases:**
- Molecular property prediction
- Biological networks (protein interactions)
- Social network analysis
- Any graph with important topological structure (rings, voids)

**Performance:** Achieves or surpasses SOTA on molecular, biological, social network datasets

**Availability:** Implementation with paper (October 2024)

## 4. Quaternion and Hypercomplex Embeddings

### 4.1 Quaternion Embeddings (QuatE)

**Release Date:** NeurIPS 2019 (foundational), extensions through 2024

**Implementation:** Multiple GitHub implementations (PyTorch)

**Geometric Space:** **Quaternion space ℍ** (4D hypercomplex numbers)

**Architecture:** Knowledge graph embeddings

**Embedding Dimensions:** Typically 50-200 (quaternion dimensions)

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Quaternions** extend complex numbers to 4D:
```
q = a + bi + cj + dk
```

where:
```
i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Non-commutative:** qp ≠ pq (captures asymmetry!)
- **Division algebra:** Every non-zero quaternion has inverse
- **Rotation group:** Unit quaternions ≅ 3D rotations (SU(2) ≅ S³)

**Hamilton Product (quaternion multiplication):**
```
(a + bi + cj + dk)(e + fi + gj + hk) =
  (ae - bf - cg - dh) +
  (af + be + ch - dg)i +
  (ag - bh + ce + df)j +
  (ah + bg - cf + de)k
```

**In Knowledge Graphs:**
```
h ⊗ r ≈ t
```
where entities h, t are quaternion vectors and relation r is quaternion rotation.

**Why Quaternions for KGs?**

1. **4D structure captures richer patterns:** Four components (1, i, j, k) represent different semantic aspects
2. **Non-commutativity models asymmetry:** Father(John, Mary) ≠ Father(Mary, John)
3. **Parameter efficiency:** 80% fewer parameters than complex-valued RotatE
4. **Compositional:** Relations compose via multiplication (transitive reasoning)
5. **Inter- and intra-dimensional interactions:** Richer than independent dimensions

**Advantages:**
- 80% parameter reduction vs RotatE (complex-valued)
- Models symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, composition naturally
- More compact representations
- Theoretically grounded (quaternion algebra)

**Use Cases:**
- Knowledge graph completion
- Link prediction
- Multi-relational reasoning
- Protein-protein interaction networks (biological KGs)

**Limitations:**
- More complex implementation than real/complex embeddings
- Requires understanding quaternion algebra
- Not all relations benefit from 4D structure

**Availability:** PyTorch implementations, some KG frameworks

**Performance:** SOTA on several KG benchmarks with complex relational patterns

### 4.2 Clifford Algebra Neural Networks

**Release Date:** Active development 2023-2024 (ICML/NeurIPS publications)

**Implementation:** Microsoft Research CliffordLayers, multiple GitHub repos

**Geometric Space:** **Clifford algebra** (geometric algebra) - generalizes complex, quaternions, and beyond

**Architecture:** Various (CNNs, GNNs, Transformers)

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Clifford algebras** are the most general hypercomplex number systems.

For n-dimensional space, Clifford algebra Cℓ(p,q,r) has basis with **2ⁿ elements** (multivectors):
- 1 scalar (grade 0)
- n vectors (grade 1)
- n(n-1)/2 bivectors (grade 2 - oriented planes)
- n(n-1)(n-2)/6 trivectors (grade 3 - oriented volumes)
- ...
- 1 pseudoscalar (grade n)

**Example: Cℓ(3,0,0) (3D Euclidean):**
- Scalar: 1
- Vectors: e₁, e₂, e₃
- Bivectors: e₁e₂, e₂e₃, e₃e₁ (oriented planes)
- Trivector: e₁e₂e₃ (oriented volume)
- **Total: 2³ = 8 basis elements**

**Geometric Product (fundamental operation):**
```
ab = a·b + a∧b
```
where:
- a·b = dot product (scalar)
- a∧b = wedge product (bivector)

**Why Clifford Algebras?**

1. **Unify geometry and algebra:** Geometric operations = algebraic operations
2. **Natural rotations:** Via **rotors** (generalization of quaternions)
3. **Multi-scale features:** Different grades = different geometric objects
4. **Physics applications:** Naturally express Maxwell's equations, Dirac equation
5. **Equivariance:** Built-in transformation properties

**Rotor (rotation operator):**
```
Rotate(v) = RvR†
```
where R is a rotor (like quaternion but generalized to any dimension).

**2024 Research Highlights:**

**1. Randomized Geometric Algebra Methods (June 2024):**

## 5. Mixed-Curvature and Product Space Embeddings

### 5.1 Mixed-Curvature Product Manifolds

**Release Date:** ICLR 2019 (foundational), active through 2024-2025

**Implementation:** GitHub: HazyResearch/hyperbolics, various extensions

**Geometric Space:** Product of spherical × hyperbolic × Euclidean

**Architecture:** Graph neural networks, knowledge graphs

**Mathematical Foundation:**

Real-world data has **heterogeneous geometry:**
- Local communities: Spherical (bounded, homogeneous)
- Global hierarchies: Hyperbolic (tree-like, exponential growth)
- Continuous features: Euclidean (flat)

**Product Manifold:**
```
𝓜 = 𝕊ⁿ¹ × ℍⁿ² × ℝⁿ³
```

Embedding:
```
x = (x_sphere, x_hyperbolic, x_euclidean)
```

Distance:
```
d(x,y)² = d_𝕊(x_s, y_s)² + d_ℍ(x_h, y_h)² + d_ℝ(x_e, y_e)²
```

**Key Insight:** Different parts of data live in different geometries. Single-curvature space (even hyperbolic) cannot optimally represent all patterns.

**Advantages:**
- Heterogeneous structure modeling
- Each component uses optimal geometry
- More flexible than single-curvature
- **Learnable curvature allocation** (automatic geometry selection)

**Organizations:** Cohere, Mixedbread.ai, Jina AI

**Implementation:** Sentence Transformers, HuggingFace, Vespa, Qdrant

**Geometric Space:** Binary hypercube {0,1}ⁿ with Hamming distance

**Architecture:** Extreme quantization of dense embeddings

**Embedding Dimensions:** 256-1024 bits

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Binarization:**
```
b_i = sign(x_i) = {
  1  if x_i ≥ 0
  0  if x_i < 0
}
```

**Hamming Distance:**
```
d_H(b₁, b₂) = ∑ᵢ (b₁_i ⊕ b₂_i) = count of differing bits
```

**Why It Works:**

1. **Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma:** Random projections preserve distances
2. **Normalized embeddings** are already close to {-1, +1}
3. **Semantic information is robust** to extreme quantization

**Hamming Distance Computation is BLAZINGLY FAST:**
```rust
// XOR the bit vectors → count 1s (population count)
let xor = bits1 ^ bits2;
let distance = xor.count_ones();  // 1-2 CPU cycles!
```

**Two-Stage Retrieval:**
1. **Binary search:** Ultra-fast approximate search (Hamming distance)

## 7. Probabilistic and Uncertainty Embeddings

### 7.1 Probabilistic Embeddings (Gaussian Embeddings)

**Release Date:** Active research 2024-2025

**Implementation:** Various research implementations

**Geometric Space:** **Distributions in embedding space** (typically Gaussians)

**Architecture:** VAE-based, Gaussian process embeddings

**Mathematical Foundation:**

Instead of point embeddings x ∈ ℝᴰ, represent data as **distributions:**
```
p(x) = 𝓝(μ_x, Σ_x)
```

where:
- μ_x = mean vector (point estimate)
- Σ_x = covariance matrix (uncertainty)

**Similarity Between Distributions:**
- **KL divergence:** D_KL(p||q) = ∫ p(x) log(p(x)/q(x)) dx
- **Wasserstein distance:** W(p, q) = optimal transport cost
- **Expected likelihood:** E_p[similarity(x, y)]

**Why Probabilistic?**

1. **Uncertainty quantification:** Ambiguous inputs → high variance (broad distribution)
2. **One-to-many mappings:** Single text → multiple plausible images (distribution covers all)
3. **Calibration:** Confidence estimates (entropy of distribution)
4. **Hierarchical modeling:** Coarse concepts = broad distributions, specific = narrow

**Uncertainty Types:**
- **Aleatoric:** Inherent data uncertainty (irreducible)
- **Epistemic:** Model uncertainty (reducible with more data)
- **Distributional:** Shape of embedding distribution

**Advantages:**
- Natural uncertainty quantification
- Better calibration than point embeddings
- Handles ambiguity and multi-modal data
- Richer representation than points

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher computational cost (2× parameters: μ and Σ)
- More complex distance computations
- Training can be unstable (VAE optimization challenges)

**Recent Work (2024-2025):**

**1. GroVE (Vision-Language):** Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models for frozen VLMs

**2. Compositional Uncertainty:** Multiple object boxes with distributions, compositional reasoning

**3. Uncertainty Types:** Decomposing aleatoric vs epistemic vs distributional

**Use Cases:**
- Cross-modal retrieval (query ambiguity)
- Active learning (select most uncertain samples)
- Visual question answering (multiple valid answers)
- Medical imaging (uncertainty is critical)
- Safety-critical applications

**Performance:** SOTA uncertainty calibration across downstream tasks

### 7.2 Box Embeddings

**Release Date:** 2018 (foundational), active through 2024

**Implementation:** Multiple research implementations

**Geometric Space:** **Axis-aligned hyperrectangles** in ℝᴰ

**Mathematical Foundation:**

Entities are **boxes** (hyperrectangles):
```
Box(e) = [min₁, max₁] × [min₂, max₂] × ... × [minᴰ, maxᴰ]
```

**Operations:**
- **Intersection:** Box₁ ∩ Box₂ (AND, conjunction)
- **Union:** Box₁ ∪ Box₂ (OR, disjunction)
- **Volume:** ∏ᵢ (maxᵢ - minᵢ) (interpretable as probability!)
- **Containment:** Box₁ ⊆ Box₂ (entailment, subsumption)

**Probabilistic Semantics:**
```
P(e) = Volume(Box(e)) = ∏ᵢ (maxᵢ - minᵢ)
```

Volume directly interpreted as probability!

**Key Insight:**

Boxes naturally represent:
- **Uncertainty:** Large boxes = uncertain, small = precise
- **Hierarchies:** Parent box contains child boxes (⊆ relation)
- **Logical operations:** Intersection (AND), union (OR)
- **Probabilities:** Volume = probability (calibrated semantics)

**Advantages:**
- Calibrated probabilistic semantics (volume = probability)

**Implementation:** Sentence Transformers 2.4+, HuggingFace

**Geometric Space:** Euclidean with **nested structure**

**Architecture:** Training paradigm (not a specific model architecture)

**Embedding Dimensions:** Flexible (e.g., [64, 128, 256, 384, 512, 768])

**Mathematical Foundation:**

**Standard embeddings:** Fixed dimension D

**Matryoshka embeddings:** x ∈ ℝᴰ where **prefixes are meaningful:**
```
x[:64]  is a useful 64-dim embedding
x[:128] is a more useful 128-dim embedding
x[:256] is even more useful
...
x[:D]   is the full embedding
```

**Training: Multi-scale Loss:**
```
Loss = ∑ᵢ λᵢ · Loss(x[:dᵢ], y[:dᵢ])
```

Train on multiple dimensions simultaneously (e.g., d ∈ {64, 128, 256, 768}).

**Key Insight:** Information is hierarchically structured. Most critical information concentrates in early dimensions, refinements in later dimensions.

**How Nesting Works:**
- First 64 dims: Most important features (coarse semantics)
- Next 64 dims (65-128): Refinements
- Next 128 dims (129-256): Further details
- etc.

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility:** Single model → multiple dimension options
- **Trade-offs:** Storage vs accuracy, speed vs quality
- **No retraining:** Truncate at inference time
- **14x speedup** for retrieval at same accuracy (64d vs 768d)
- **14x compression** at same quality

**Use Cases:**

**1. Adaptive Retrieval:**
```
Stage 1: Fast pass with 64 dims (filter 100K → 1K)
Stage 2: Slow rerank with 768 dims (final ranking)
```

**2. Edge Devices:**
- Use 64-128 dims (limited memory)

**3. Cost Optimization:**
- Balance storage/compute/quality

**4. Multi-Stage Pipelines:**
- Different stages use different dimensions

**Example Models with Matryoshka (2024):**
- **Jina Embeddings v3:** 32-1024 dims
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3:** 256-3072 dims
- **Cohere Embed v4:** 256, 512, 1024, 1536 dims
- **Nomic Embed v1.5:** 64-768 dims
- **Stella EN v5:** 512-8192 dims
- **Many more** (nearly universal adoption in 2024!)

**Recent Work (2024-2025):**

**1. Franca:** Nested Matryoshka Clustering for visual representation

**2. Matryoshka + Binary:** Combine flexible dimensions with 32x compression

**3. Integration:** Major embedding frameworks (Sentence Transformers, HF)

**Performance:**
- Up to **14x smaller** with same accuracy (ImageNet-1K)
- **14x speedup** for retrieval
- 256d can outperform 1536d fixed models (OpenAI result)

**Availability:** Native support in Sentence Transformers, widespread

**Why This Matters:** Flexibility without retraining, now standard in 2024-2025 models.
